# TMSG.IO

An app to play with Twilio's Messaging API.

Right now it has the ability to send an text message to a phone number inputted. But there is so much more left to do.

## Roadmap
* Setup Mailers to work properly
* Do the Message sending in a Job
* Logging of messages
* Create account limits, allow user to subscribe for more messages per month.
 * Free/Basic/Pro plans
 * Pro comes with better logging / scheduled messages?
 * Address Book of people to message for folks on Basic / Pro?
* Would like to be able to handle the replies in some shape or fashion
* Admin Interface for viewing logs / account limits / subscribed users etc.
* The ability to send a shortened 'message' could be nice, give the user a way to click to read more sort of like twitlonger.
